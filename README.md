##  A Fairly Sane and Minimal Set of Config

### Homebrew
Prefer the most current packages we can get so install [Homebrew](http://brew.sh)

``` Shell
brew install awscli
brew install aws-elasticbeanstalk
brew install git
brew install httpie
brew install node
brew install postgresql
brew install python
brew install python3
brew install ruby
brew install tmux
brew install vim
brew install yarn
brew install zsh
# Add /usr/local/bin/zsh to /etc/shells then set your shell with the following
chsh -s /usr/local/bin/zsh
brew install zsh-completions
```

### Fonts
Adobe's [Source Code Pro](https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-code-pro) is very nice.

### Sublime Packages
- [Pretty JSON](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Pretty%20JSON)

- [TOML](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/TOML)
- [VCS Gutter](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/VCS%20Gutter)
